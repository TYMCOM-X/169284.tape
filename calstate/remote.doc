VERSION 222.03

        THIS VERSION FIXES A PROBLEM WITH VERSION 222.02 WHEREIN
INSUFFICIENT SPACE WAS ALLOCATED FOR THE CHECKSUM POOL IN CERTAIN
CONFIGURATIONS.

        ALSO, ADDITIONAL PATCH SPACE HAS BEEN ALLOCATED FOR DATA SERVICE
PERSONEL TO PATCH MESSAGES INTO.
VERSION 222.02

        THIS VERSION FIXES SEVERAL BUGS ENCOUNTERED IN FIELD-TEST OF
VERSION 222.01, NOTABLY IN THE 201-INTERRUPT STRUCTURE AS APPLIED TO
THE V-73 COMPUTER.

        1.  THE CODE IN VERSIONS 221 AND BEFORE SCANNED FOR A LINE
TO PROCESS.  VERSION 222 CHANGED THIS TO A TIGHTER CODE, SINCE THE
PREVIOUS USE EXPENDED A LOT OF CPU POWER.  HOWEVER THE NEW CODE
(WHICH IS IDENTICAL TO THAT RUNNING IN THE BASES) DIDN'T WORK IN THE
V73.  THE PROBLEM WAS TRACED TO A SEQUENCE OF INSTRUCTIONS WHICH WAS
NOT INTERRUPTABLE IN THE 620'S, BUT WHICH WAS INTERRUPTABLE IN
THE V73.  THE SEQUENCE HAS BEEN CHANGED.

        2.  V73 POWER UP INTERRUPT TIMING HAS BEEN IMPROVED.

        3.  SEVERAL LITTERAL CONSTANTS HAVE BEEN RE-DEFINED IN TERMS
OF STANDARD CONSTANTS.

        4.  AT THE REQUEST OF DATA SERVICE PEOPLE, A MECHANISM HAS BEEN
IMPLEMENTED TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE GENERATION OF MESSAGES LOCAL TO
THE TYMSAT.  THIS WOULD PERMIT THE OUTPUTTING OF A MESSAGE TO INDICATE
WHEN A NODE WOULD BE OFF THE AIR, AS DURING SCHEDULED MAINTAINANCE.
VERSION 222.01

        THIS VERSION FIXES THREE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN FIELD-TESTING
VERSION 222.00.

        1.  UNINITIALIZED STORAGE WAS INCLUDED WITHIN SPAN OF A
CHECKSUM BLOCK, CAUSING ERONIOUS CHECKSUM REPORTING.

        2.  THE "PLEASE TYPE THE LETTER D" MESSAGE WAS CHANGED, BUT
THE INFORMATION WAS NOT DISTRIBUTED.  IT IS CHANGED TO TYPE THE
MESSAGE "TYPE D" FOLLOWED BY BELLS AT 10, 15, AND 30 CPS.  A FUTURE
RELEASE WILL OUTPUT ONLY THE BELLS.

        3.  A NEW "PARAMETER D" TERMINAL CHARACTERISTIC IS DEFINED
TO PERMIT AN ALTERNATE DELAY TO BE GENERATED AFTER LINE-FEED ON
CARRIAGE-RETURN-DELAY TERMINALS, AND VICE VERSA.  THIS ELIMINATES
(FORMALIZES) THE EXISTING KLUDGE FOR TYPE 'C' AND 'F' TERMINALS,
AND ADDS A 1-CHARACTER DELAY AFTER LINE-FEED FOR TYPE 'E' TERMINALS,
MAKING TYPE 'E' COMPATABLE WITH BOTH T. I. TYPE 100 AND 700 TERMINALS.
VERSION 222.00

        THE FOLLOWING CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO VERSIONS 221.XX.

        1.  A BUG RELATING TO TYPE "G" TERMINALS FOUND IN VERSION
221.02 HAS BEEN FIXED.  THE BUG CAUSED AN IMPROPER DELAY TO BE
GENERATED AFTER LINE-FEED FOR BLANK LINES.

        2.  A CRASH CODE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.  THE IMPLEMENTATION
CONSISTS OF THE ADDITION OF A SPECIAL CODE AT EACH LOCATION WHERE
A CRASH MIGHT OCCUR.  THIS CODE IS SAVED UPON A CRASH, AND IS THEN
REPORTED TO THE SUPERVISOR AT THE NEXT TAKEOVER.  THE CODE UNIQUELY
DEFINES THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH, AND ALSO CONTAINS INFORMATION AS TO
THE PLACE THAT ROUTINE WAS CALLED FROM.

        3.  POWER-FAILURE CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED.  PREVIOUSLY A POWER-
DOWN INTERRUPT CAUSED THE MACHINE TO GO INTO STEP, WITH THE LOCATION
COUNTER (P-REGISTER) UNCHANGED.  THIS CAN EXPLAIN SOME OF THE CASES
OBSERVED, WHERE A NODE WILL GO INTO STEP.  THE CODE NOW CONTAINS A
JMPM IN THE POWER-DOWN LOCATION, AND A JMP IN THE POWER-UP LOCATION.
THESE GO TO A NEW ROUTINE WHICH HALTS ON POWER-DOWN AND CRASHES ON
POWER-UP.  IN ADDITION, A 10-SECOND DELAY IS GENERATED ON V73 CPU'S
ON POWER-UP TO PERMIT ALL POWER SUPPLIES TO STABILIZE.

        4.  A SWITCH-CONTROLLED DEBUGGER HAS BEEN ADDED, TO EASE FUTURE
RELEASES.  THIS CODE WILL NOT APPEAR IN ANY FIELD RELEASES.

        5.  EXTRA CODE HAS BEEN ADDED TO DRIVE THE FRONT-PANEL LIGHTS
ON A V73.  THERE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINTS FROM MAINTAINANCE THAT AN UNLIT
CONSOL LEAVES QUESTIONS AS TO OPERATION OPEN.  THE LIGHTS ARE DRIVEN
FROM THE 1200-CYCLE INTERUPT, AND SHOW THE LOCATION INTERRUPTED FROM.

        6.  THE "AVERAGE" CODE FOR EXPERIMENTAL TESTING HAS BEEN
DELETED, SINCE NO LONGER NECESSARY.

        7.  THE "ZAPPER-IN-PORT-BUFFER" LOGIC, WHICH WAS NOT FULLY
IMPLEMENTED, HAS BEEN DELETED.

        8.  TERMINAL TYPES "I" AND "N" HAVE BEEN DELETED.

        9.  THE LINE-SNIPPING LOGIC HAS BEEN EXTENDED.  SPECIFICALLY,
A CELL "USLINE" HAS BEEN ADDED, SO A LINE MAY BE UNSNIPPED READILY BY
USE OF THE NETWORK DEBUGGER.  ALSO, LINE-SNIPPING REPORTS HAVE BEEN
CHANGED FROM REPORT CODE 5 TO REPORT CODE 24, TO PREVENT CONFUSION WITH
LINE-OUT REPORTS.

        10. ANSWER-AND-HANG LOGIC HAS BEEN CLEANED UP SLIGHTLY, IN TERMS
OF THE ASSEMBLY-SWITCH OPTIONS AND TESTS REQUIRED.  THE EFECT OF THE
CODE WILL NOT CHANGE.

        11. THE ROUTINE "BID" HAS BEEN EXPANDED, SUCH THAT IT REQUIRES
MORE SPACE BUT TAKES LESS TIME.

        12. EXCESS CODE FOR MORE THAN 3 LINES HAS BEEN DELETED.

        13. CHECKSUM CODE IS EXERCISED EVERY 8 SECONDS, RATHER THAN
EVERY 256 SECONDS.

        14. THE EFFICIENCY OF 201-LINE CLEANUP POLLING HAS BEEN
IMPROVED.  ALSO, THE CORRESPONDING INTERRUPT ROUTINES HAVE BEEN
SHORTENED BY 3 CYCLES EACH.
VERSION 221.04

        THIS VERSION FIXES TWO PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN PREVIOUS RELEASES
OF VERSION 221 REMOTE CODE.

        BECAUSE A SERIES OF CHANGES RELATING TO LINE-SNIPPING RELATED
TO BOTH THE NODES AND TO THE SUPERVISOR WAS INCOMPLETE, THE SUPERVISOR
TREATED LINE-SNIP REPORTS AS LINE-OUT REPORTS, LEADING TO ERRONIOUS
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CONDITION WHEN IT OCCURED.  THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED
BY CHANGING THE REPORT CODE SENT BY THE NODE.  IN THIS AND ALL FUTURE
RELEASES, A LINE-SNIP WILL BE A REPORT TYPE 24.

        A MINOR PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED WHEN CHANGING PARITY WHICH CAUSED
INCORRECT ECHOING HAS BEEN FIXED.

        IN ADDITION, SEVERAL UNUSED TRACE STATEMENTS LEFT OVER FROM
DEBUGGING THE CODE HAVE BEEN DELETED.  THIS WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE
CODE, SINCE THEY WERE NOT ASSEMBLED FOR FIELD VERSIONS.

        THIS RELEASE IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR THESE
PROBLEMS, WHILE VERSION 222 IS STILL IN FIELD TEST.
VERSION 221.03

        THIS VERSION FIXES A BUG RELATING TO TYPE G TERMINALS.
VERSION 221.02

        THIS FIXES A BUG IN VERSION 221.01 WHICH CAN OCCASIONALLY CAUSE
THE NODE TO CRASH AT TAKE-OVER.
VERSION 221.01

        THIS VERSION CORRECTS A BUG WHICH DATES BACK TO VERSION 217.
THE BUG MAY, ON RARE OCCASIONS, CAUSE A DEAD-END CIRCUIT TO BE LEFT
IN THE NETWORK WHEN A CIRCUIT IS TORN DOWN IMPROPERLY.
VERSION 221.00

        THIS VERSION IS A GENERAL RELEASE OF VERSION 220 WITH ALL
FLAWS AND ERRORS ENCOUNTERED DURING FIELD TESTING OF V220 FIXED.

        THIS CODE ALSO INCLUDES ALL NECESSARY CHANGES TO SUPPORT THE
VARIAN V73 CPU.  THIS REQUIRES A NEW ASSEMBLY SWITCH.  HENCEFORTH,
THE SWITCH "V73" MUST APPEAR IN THE NODE PARAMETER FILES, AND MUST BE
SET =0 FOR 620-MACHINES, AND =-1 FOR V73-MACHINES.
VERSION 220.00

        THE FOLLOWING CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO VERSION 217:

        1.  FLAGS AND TEMP CELLS HAVE BEEN REORDERED SO THEY MAY BE
INITIALIZED IN BLOCKS BY THE CRASH ROUTINE.

        2.  CODE HAS BEEN ADDED TO READ AND SET SINGLE-BIT TERMINAL
CHARACTERISTICS.  THIS WILL EVENTUALLY PERMIT THE HOST TO QUERY THE
REMOTE AS TO A TERMINAL'S CHARACTERISTICS, INSTEAD OF HAVING A LOCAL
(AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE) VERSION OF THE PARAMETER.

        3.  CODE HAS BEEN ADDED TO CONTROL 30-CPS INPUT.  THIS CODE
WILL BE ENABLED BY A SPECIAL COMMAND FROM THE HOST, AND WILL THEN
SEND X-ON/X-OFF CHARACTERS AS NECESSARY TO CASSETTE TERMINALS TO PREVENT
POSSIBLE ACCUMULATION OF INPUT CHARACTERS LEADING TO BUFFER ZAPS IN
THE REMOTE, WITH CONSEQUENT LOSS OF CHARACTERS.  (NORMAL NETWORK
CONTROL SHOULD PREVENT BUFFER-ZAPS IN INTERMEDIATE NODES.)

        4.  TWO NEW BALL CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN DEFINED--BLACK AND GREY
BALLS.  WHENEVER A BUFFER IS ZAPPED, IT WILL BE REPLACED BY A BLACK
BALL.  IF A BLACK BALL IS RECEIVED BY A REMOTE, IT IS REFLECTED AS
A GREY BALL.  THE HOST MAY THEN DETERMINE IF A BUFFER WAS ZAPPED,
ANYWHERE ALONG THE CIRCUIT, EITHER ON INPUT OR OUTPUT, AND MAY INFORM
THE USER OF THE CONDITION WITH ANY LOCAL CONVENTION DESIRED.

        5.  A ROUTINE, ZAPLIN, HAS BEEN ADDED.  THIS REPLACES EXISTING
CODE AS A CLOSED ROUTINE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE SUPERVISOR AND THEN
ZAP ALL CIRCUITS ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIED LINE.  THIS CONDITION
NO LONGER OCCURS IN JUST ONE PART OF THE REMOTE CODE.

        6.  THE ROUTINE "RTD" HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY MODIFIED:
  A.  THE CODE FORMERLY LABELED "RBD" HAS NOW BEEN INCORPORATED.  THIS
MEANS THAT BACK PRESSURE IS APPLIED AS SOON AS IT IS RECEIVED FROM A
NEIGHBOR.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO CHECK FOR CORRECT LENGTH OF BUFFER
RESTRICTIONS, AND THUS TO SNIP THE LINE IF THE TWO NODES DO NOT AGREE,
INSTEAD OF CRASHING, AS PREVIOUSLY.
  B.  SUPERVISORY LOGICAL RECORDS ARE VERIFIED FOR MULTIPLES OF 6
CHARACTERS.  IF NOT, THE LINE IS SNIPPED, INSTEAD OF THE NODE CRASHING.
  C.  A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF 0 RECEIVED CAUSES THE LINE TO BE
SNIPPED, INSTEAD OF CRASHING AS PREVIOUSLY.
  D.  THE CODE CHECKS FOR A "NO-EXCEPTIONS" FLAG ON EACH LOGICAL
RECORD.  IF SET, THE DATA IS NOT CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF ZAPPERS,
GOBBLERS, AND GOUGERS.  THESE OCCUR VERY INFREQUENTLY, AND ARE TESTED
FOR BY "RMAKE", WHO CAN THUS SET THE FLAG WITH MINIMAL OVERHEAD.  THE
FACT THAT OLDER NODES DO NOT SET THE FLAG IS NOT CRITICAL, SINCE THEY
DO INSURE IT IS CLEARED.  THUS ALL RECORDS FROM OLDER-VERSION NEIGHBORS
WILL BE CHECKED, BUT A FAIR AMOUNT OF OVERHEAD WILL BE AVOIDED FROM
NEWER-VERSION NEIGHBORS.
  E.  SNIPPING A LINE CONSISTS OF CALLING "ZAPLIN", RESETTING THE LINE,
AND ALTERNATING THE RESET PATTERN EXPECTED.  (THIS IS DESCRIBED IN 7.)
THE LINE WILL NOT COME RESET UNTIL IT HAS BEEN ADAPTED AT ONE END.
THUS IF A NODE FINDS A NEIGHBOR BAD, THE NEIGHBOR IS CUT OFF AND
ISOLATED.  IF THE NODE IS REALLY SICK, IT THUS ISOLATES ITSELF.  IF THE
NEIGHBOR IS SICK, ALL OF HIS NEIGHBORS WILL ISOLATE HIM.  IN EITHER
CASE, THE ERROR IS NOT PROPOGATED THROUGH THE NETWORK, AS HAS HAPPENED
IN THE PAST.  SPECIFICALLY, A SICK NODE WILL NOT CRASH THE NEIGHBORS,
AND THEIR PASSTHROUGH TRAFFIC CAN CONTINUE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY.

        7.  ADAPTIVE RESETS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED.  ON ANY LINE, THERE
ARE TWO DIFFERENT RESET PATTERNS WHICH MAY BE USED.  IF THE TWO NODES
ON THE LINE AGREE ON THE RESET CURRENTLY IN USE, THE LINE IS UP.  IF
NOT, THE LINE HAS BEEN SNIPPED.  EACH NODE HAS A TABLE OF RESET PATTERNS
TO USE AND TO EXPECT FOR EACH LINE.  FOR EACH LINE, THERE IS ALSO A
TABLE CALLED THE ADAPTER, WITH AN ENTRY FOR EACH LINE.  WHEN A NODE
CRASHES, IT SETS THE ADAPTER.  EACH RESET PATTERN RECEIVED IS COMPARED
WITH THE EXPECTOR PATTERN.  IF A MATCH IS FOUND, THE ADAPTER IS RESET
AND THE TRANSMITOR IS MADE THE SAME AS THE EXPECTOR.  THUS THE NODE
HAS ADAPTED TO THE RESET TRANSMITTED BY THE NEIGHBOR.  IF NO MATCH
OCCURS, THE ALTERNATE RESET PATTERNS ARE TRIED AS LONG AS THE ADAPTER
IS SET, AND A MATCH MUST EVENTUALLY OCCUR.  THUS A NODE WHICH CRASHES
(OR IS RELOADED) WILL AUTOMATICALLY COME UP CORRECTLY WITH ALL THE
NEIGHBORS.  IF A LINE HAS BEEN SNIPPED, IT CAN BE BROUGHT UP BY SETTING
THE APPROPRIATE ADAPTOR AT EITHER NODE.  THAT NODE WILL THEN RE-ADAPT TO
ITS NEIGHBOR.  PROVISION IS MADE FOR A SUPERVISOR COMMAND TO DO THIS.
AN ADAPTIVE NODE IS COMPATABLE WITH A CURRENT, NON-ADAPTIVE NODE,
EXCEPT THAT, IF IT SNIPS THE LINE, IT MUST BE THE NODE WHICH RE-ADAPTS.

        8.  IN LINE WITH LINE ADAPTATION, THE ARRAYS RESETI, RESETO,
AND ADAPT HAVE BEEN ADDED, WITH ONE WORD IN EACH ARRAY FOR EACH LINE.

        9.  THE FLAGS AND TEMP CELLS SECTION HAS BEEN RE-ARRANGED TO
PERMIT OF LESS CODE IN THE CRASH ROUTINE.

        10.  THE TF TABLES AND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS HAVE BEEN
RE-FORMATTED.

        11.  CODE HAS BEEN ADDED (TEMPORARILY) TO DETERMINE THE
ADVANTAGES (IF ANY) OF SIGNAL-AVERAGING ON THE DIAL-UP INPUT LINES.
THIS CODE WILL NOT BE ACTIVE IN ANY FIELD RELEASES.

        12.  THE QUASI-START-BAUD CODE HAS BEEN LARGELY SCRAPPED, AND
IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING CONVERTED TO A QUASI-CHARACTER-ASSEMBLER.
THIS CODE IS NOT READY TO USE, AND WILL NOT APPEAR IN FIELD RELEASES.

        13.  FOR CONVENIENCE IN READING THE LISTINGS, VARIOUS TABLES
HAVE BEEN MOVED TO THE END OF THE LISTING.  THERE IS NO EFFECT ON
EXECUTION.

        14.  ADDITIONAL TESTING IS NOW PERFORMED ON SUPERVISORY
COMMANDS.  ALL MESSAGES HEADING DOWN-STREAM (OTHER THAN TAKE-OVER FOR
THE SPECIFIC NODE) IS REQUIRED TO HAVE COME FROM THE UP-STREAM
DIRECTION, OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SUPERVISOR AS AN
ERROR.  THIS WILL REDUCE THE CHANCE OF PROCESSING A SPURIOUS MESSAGE
FROM LINES OTHER THAN THAT TO THE SUPERVISOR, AND SHOULD HELP IN
DIAGNOSING NETWORK PROBLEMS.  ALSO, IF THE NODE HAS NO DOWN-STREAM
POINTER, ANY MESSAGES RECEIVED HEADING UPSTREAM ARE INVALID, AND WILL
BE SO REPORTED TO THE SUPERVISOR.  THIS SHOULD HELP IN LOCATING THOSE
NODES WHICH OCCASIONALLY GENERATE A SUPERVISOR MESSAGE WITH AN INVALID
NODE NUMBER.  THE NODE DETECTING THE ERROR WILL REPORT TO THE SUPERVISOR
AND WILL GIVE SOME IDEA OF THE LOCATION OF THE OFFENDING NODE.

        15.  CURRENT NODES PERMIT A USER TO TYPE A CONTROL-H ON LOGIN
TO SPECIFY THAT HIS TERMINAL IS HALF-DUPLEX.  TWO ADDITIONAL CONTROL
CHARACTERS WILL NOW BE PROCESSED:  CONTROL-P TO SPECIFY THAT THE
TERMINAL REQUIRES EVEN PARITY; CONTROL-X TO SET THE PORT TO X-ENABLE
(SEE 3. ABOVE).  WHILE GENERAL USERS CAN USE HOST PROGRAMS TO SET
THESE STATES, THE TYMCOM USERS CANNOT.  THIS FACILITY IS ADDED MAINLY
FOR THEIR BENEFIT.

        16.  THE NODE WILL REPORT IF IT IS RUNNING VERY SLOWLY.
THIS REPORT WILL OCCUR IF THE NODE EXECUTES THE HALF-SECOND LOGIC
LESS THAN ONCE A SECOND.

        17.  A LOCATION "QUIKCK" HAS BEEN DEFINED.  SETTING THIS CELL
NEGATIVE WILL CAUSE THE NODE TO BE CHECKSUMMED ONCE, AT HIGH SPEED.

        18.  THE CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED SUCH THAT NODES ASSEMBLED WITH
THE "ONLY16" SWITCH PARAMETER WILL NOT LOOK AT THE SECOND PORT-GROUP.
CURRENTLY THIS SWITCH AFFECTED "SBOD" BUT A STRANGE SIGNAL COULD STILL
CAUSE A NON-EXISTANT PORT TO BE PROCESSED FOR ANSWERING, ETC.



                        I M P O R T A N T

        THIS CODE WILL FIT ONLY IN 12-K NODES!
VERSION 217.01

        THIS VERSION CORRECTS A SLIGHT BUG IN VERSION 217.00.

        THE BUG WAS IN THE HANDLING OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF ERROR IN
CARBAGE COLLECTION, PRODUCING A CRASH.

VERSION 217.00


        THE FOLLOWING CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO VERSION 216.01:

        1.  THE REMOTE CODE NOW HAS A CHECKSUM CAPABILITY.  12-K
NODES CHECK THE CODE PERIODICALLY, AND REPORT TO THE SUPERVISOR IF
ANY OF THE CODE DOES NOT CHECKSUM CORRECTLY.  THIS CHANGE REQUIRES
VERSION 6 OR HIGHER OF VAS TO ASSEMBLE PROPERLY.

        2.  THE CHARACTER TRANSMITTER MECHANISM HAS BEEN CHANGED,
ELIMINATING REDUNDANT CODING AND EXPEDITING CHARACTER TRANSMISSION.
AN INCIDENTAL FEATURE OF THE NEW MECHANISM IS THAT APPROXIMATELY
20-25% OF TRANSMIT CYCLES/CHARACTER HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

        3.  VARIOUS BUGS IN THE REMOTE-LINE-PRINTER CODE HAVE BEEN
FIXED.

        4.  A NEW PREFIX CODE (17-1) HAS BEEN DEFINED.  RECOGNIZED
ONLY BY A 2741-TYPE TERMINAL, IT CAUSES THE PHONE TO HANG UP
UNCONDITIONALLY (AS WHEN THE KEYBOARD IS LOCKED, AND NO MESSAGE
CAN BE TRANSMITTED).

        5.  TWO ADDITIONAL PREFIX CODES HAVE BEEN DEFINED.  THESE ARE:
(17-2) ENTER 2741 TRANSPARENCY, AND (17-3) LEAVE 2741 TRANSPARENCY.
THESE ARE INTENDED TO REPLACE THE CURRENT "GLASS CHARACTERS" (16-0,
16-1), IN ORDER TO EXPAND FUTURE PREFIX USAGE.

        6.  WHEN A TERMINAL HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED (RESPONSE TO "PLEASE
TYPE THE LETTER D"), A LINE IS OUTPUT IDENTIFYING THE NODE AND PORT,
OF FORM: "-1054-07--"; INDICATING THAT THE USER HAS DIALED INTO PORT
7 OF NODE 1054.  THIS INFORMATION WILL BE OF USE TO DATA-SERVICES,
WHEN CALLED ABOUT POSSIBLE BAD MODEMS, LINES, OR TERMINALS.

        7.  ASCII TRANSMIT LOGIC HAS BEEN CHANGED SUCH THAT OUTPUT
CHARACTERS ARE EXAMINED FOR THE PRESENCE OF CONTROL-I (HORIZ. TAB).
WHEN FOUND, THE COUNT OF CHARACTERS TRANSMITTED WILL BE FORCED TO
THE NEXT MULTIPLE OF 8.  THIS ELIMINATES POSSIBILITIES OF LOST
CHARACTERS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (I.E., IF 8 TABS ARE OUTPUT,
FOLLOWED BY C/R, THE ACTUAL PRINT POSITION IS AT CHAR 64.  REMOTES
PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED C/R DELAY ON THE BASIS OF BEING AT CHAR 8,
WITH THE RESULTING POSSIBILITY OF INSUFFICIENT DELAY.)

        8.  ADDITIONAL SUPERVISOR MESSAGES ARE INCLUDED IN 12-K NODES.
THESE INCLUDE:
        "PLEASE SEE YOUR TIMESHARE REPRESENTATIVE..."
        "BAD MUD"
        "OUT OF CHANNELS"
        "OUT OF PORTS"
THIS ADDITION SHOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SUPERVISORY TRAFFIC
SIGNIFICANTLY.

        9.  VARIOUS PIECES OF THE CODE HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP, MOVED
AROUND, AND COMMENTED.

        10.  TERMINAL IDENTIFICATION CHARACTER "I" HAS BEEN ADDED.
THIS IS FOR A TEXAS-INSTRUMENT "SILENT 700" TERMINAL.  ALL TERMINAL
CHARACTERISTICS ARE IDENTICAL TO TYPE "E" TERMINALS, EXCEPT THAT
PARAMETER 'B' HAS THE VALUE 5, RATHER THAN 3.  THESE TERMINALS WILL
BE IDENTIFIED TO THE SUPERVISOR AND HOSTS AS "E" TERMINALS (TYPE CODE
= 3), UNTIL SUCH TIME AS ALL RELEVENT MACHINES CAN RECOGNIZE A TYPE
CODE = 13, AT WHICH TIME THE REMOTES WILL BE CHANGED TO REPORT THE
CORRECT TYPE CODE.  IN THE INTERIM, HOSTS WILL NOT HAVE A CORRECT RECORD
OF THE PARAMETERS FOR TYPE "I" TERMINALS.

        11.  ON BUFFER ZAPS, THE VALUE REPORTED IS NOW THE ACTUAL BUFFER
NUMBER, RATHER THAN THE BUFFER POINTER ADDRESS, AS PREVIOUSLY.

        12.  DURING LOG-IN, EACH CHARACTER ENTERED IS TRANSMITTED TO
THE SUPERVISOR AS A SEPERATE SUPERVISORY RECORD, CAUSING A 6-TO-1
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN USE.  THE CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED
TO EXAMINE LOG-IN CHARACTERS FOR THE PRESENCE OF NULL CHARACTERS, AND
TO DISCARD THESE WHEN FOUND.  (HARD-WIRED TERMINALS, WHEN TURNED OFF,
APPEAR TO GENERATE A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF NULLS:  THIS FIX SHOULD
CUT DOWN THE AMMOUNT OF SUPERVISORY TRAFFIC DUE TO THIS CASE.)

        13.  THE GARBAGE COLLECTION PART OF 'WCI' HAS BEEN MODIFIED AT
THE POINT WHERE BUFFER-ZAPS ARE GENERATED.  PREVIOUSLY, THE LARGEST
BUFFER FOUND WOULD BE ZAPPED.  NOW, THE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTION IS
PROVIDED THAT THE LARGEST BUFFER FOUND WILL NOT INCLUDE THE BUFFER
FOR WHICH THEENT CHARACTER IS INTENDED.  THIS ELIMINATES SEVERAL
CLASSES OF PROBLEMS:  1.  INCORRECT RESULTS OBTAINED WHEN THE SECOND
CHARACTER OF A CHARACTER PAIR CAUSES THE BUFFER CONTAINING THE FIRST
CHARACTER OF THE PAIR TO BE ZAPPED;  2.  WILDLY INCORRECT RESULTS
OBTAINED WHEN PART OF A SUPERVISOR MESSAGE IS ZAPPED BY THE ENTERING
OF THE REST OF THE MESSAGE...SUDDENLY THE NETWORK MAY BE FULL OF
SPURIOUS TAKEOVERS,  AND EVEN OCCASIONAL COMMANDS TO RE-WRITE SOME
PART OF A NODE.  NOTE THAT BUFFER ZAPS ON SUPERVISORY BUFFERS HAVE NOT
BEEN ELIMINATED, BUT INSTEAD DELAYED SUCH THAT AN INTEGRAL NUMBER OF
SUPERVISOR MESSAGES ARE ZAPPED.

        14.  THE TAKE-OVER LEPRECHAN HAS BEEN MODIFIED SUCH THAT IT
VERIFIES THE VALIDITY OF A TAKEOVER COMMAND BEFORE ACTING ON IT.  IF
NOT FOUND VALID, IT IS RETURNED TO THE CURRENT SUPERVISOR AS AN
ERROR INDICATION.

        15.  SPECIAL CODE HAS BEEN ADDED TO VERSION 217 (WHICH WILL NOT
BE CARRIED FORWARD TO FUTURE VERSIONS) TO PERFORM SOME STATISTIC
GATHERING ON 201-LINE USAGE.  THIS CODE IS IF'ED OUT WITH THE SWITCH
"DIAGNOSE", AND WILL ONLY APPEAR IN THE WCO MACHINES.

        16.  'HOOKS' HAVE BEEN ADDED FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

        A. 201 LOGICAL RECORDS ARE RESTRICTED TO 63 CHARACTERS IN
LENGTH OR LESS.  THIS IS IN PREPARATION FOR USING BITS IN LOGICAL
RECORD HEADERS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.


                A T T E N T I O N ! ! ! !

        REMOTE CODE HAS GROWN TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT ON CERTAIN MACHINES
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR R217 CODE.  (THESE NODES INCLUDE OAK1 AND SIMULAR
CONFIGURATIONS.)  THE CURRENT RESTRICTIONS IS THAT THE CODE WILL NOT FIT
INTO ANY NODE WITH 8-K CORE, MARK-XV, 32 PORTS, 3 201-LINES, .AND. 7
GROUPS, SIMULTANEOUSLY.  IT SHOULD FIT INTO ANY NODE WHERE ONE OR MORE
OF THESE CONDITIONS IS FALSE.  SINCE R217 CODE HAS MANY ENHANCEMENTS,
ALL POSSIBLE EFFORT SHOULD THUS BE MADE TO MAKE ROOM IN THESE FULL
NODES, EITHER BY REDUCING LINES AND GROUPS, OR REDUCING PORTS, OR BY
UPGRADING THESE NODES TO 12-K AS SOON AS POSSIBLE (PREFERED SOLUTION).
        SINCE FUTURE CODE WILL BE EVEN BIGGER, ANY CHANGES OTHER THAN
GOING TO 12-K MACHINES WILL ONLY BE A TEMPORARY SOLUTION.
VERSION 216.01

        THE FOLLOWING CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE TO VERSION 216:

        1. THE NEW ASSEMBLY SWITCH 'NOPASSTHRU' HAS BEED DEFINED TO
PERMIT THE GENERATION OF REMOTES (SUCH AS LAB1) WHERE PASS-THROUGH
TRAFFIC IS UNDESIRABLE.
VERSION 216.00

        THE FOLLOWING CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO VERSION 215.01:

                MAJOR CHANGES

        1. 'RMAKE' HAS BEEN MODIFIED SUCH THAT SUPERVISORY MESSAGE
TRAFFIC WILL HAVE PRIORITY.  THIS SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE
TAKEOVER TIME.

        2. 'CRASH' HAS BEEN MODIFIED SUCH THAT ON A CRASH, NON-ZERO
VALUES OF LINE-ERROR AND LINE-OVERLOAD WILL BE REPORTED TO THE
SUPERVISOR.

        3. NON-ZERO LINE-ERRORS WILL BE UNCONDITIONALLY REPORTED
WHENEVER A LINE IS RESET.

        4. THE MECHANISM OF ASSEMBLING PORT INPUT CHARACTERS HAS BEEN
CHANGED TO TAKE SLIGHTLY LESS TIME (2 CYCLES/BAUD).

        5. A MECHANISM IS PROVIDED IN 12-K REMOTES TO "SNAPSHOT" THE
AMMOUNT OF BUFFER SPACE IN USE AND REPORT THIS PERIODICALLY (EVERY
256 SECONDS).  THIS PROCESS IS A TEMPORARY INTRODUCTION TO HELP
ASSAY BUFFER USAGE IN REAL ENVIRONMENTS WITH A VIEW TOWARD IMPROVED
PERFORMANCE.  THE REPORTING IS TURNED ON BY SETTING 'BUFREPRT'
(CELL 76) NON-ZERO.  THE ENSUING REPORTS ARE NUMBER 76.

        6. THE 'PLEASE-LOG-IN' LOGIC HAS BEEN CHANGED.  THIS IS WITHIN
THE HALF-SECOND LOGIC.  PREVIOUSLY, WHENEVER A TERMINAL WAS IDENTIFIED,
THE MESSAGE "PLEASE LOG IN" WAS OUTPUT, AND THE HALF-SECOND LOGIC WAS
ABORTED, THEREBY DELAYING ANSWER-AND-HANG, BUFFER-RESTRICTION REPORTING,
AND ALL SUBSEQUENT SECOND LOGIC BY A HALF-SECOND.  THE ABORT AND
CONSEQUENT DELAY HAS BEEN REMOVED.

        7. A MECHANISM HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE SUPERVISOR TO CLEAR
A PORT-OUTPUT-BUFFER DURING THE LOGIN PROCESS.  THIS WILL PERMIT THE
ELIMINATION OF REDUNDANT "PLEASE LOG IN" MESSAGES IF THE USER TYPES
SEVERAL ESCAPES IN A ROW.

        8. AN ERROR HAS BEEN CORRECTED IN THE SECOND PRINTER LOGIC
WHICH WOULD ACT INCORRECTLY IF THE SECOND PRINTER-PORT PHONE WAS
HUNG UP.

        9. AT TAKEOVER, THE DOWNSTREAM POINTER IS UNCONDITIONALLY
RESET, SO THAT NEW SUPERVISOR MESSAGES ARE RETURNED UNTIL DOWNSTREAM
IS SET BY THE NEW SUPERVISOR.

        10. THE NEW ASSEMBLY SWITCH 'NOPASSTHRU' HAS BEED DEFINED TO
PERMIT THE GENERATION OF REMOTES (SUCH AS LAB1) WHERE PASS-THROUGH
TRAFFIC IS UNDESIRABLE.


                MINOR CHANGES

        1. THE WORD 'FRECOR' HAS BEEN DEFINED, AND CONTAINS A NUMBER
WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF WORDS OF CODE-SPACE STILL UNUSED IN ANY NODE.
THE INTENT IS TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM TO DETERMINE WHAT REMOTE NODES
SHOULD BE UPGRADED TO 12-K MACHINES.  THIS DATA WILL PROBABLY BE REMOVED
WHEN ALL REMOTES ARE FINALLY UPGRADED.

        2. THE VARIABLE 'SPACE', USED ONLY IN MARK XV NODES, HAS BEEN
PARAMETERIZED SUCH THAT IT EXISTS ONLY IN THOSE NODES.

        3. THE CELL 'MW2' HAS BEEN DELETED.  USED ONLY BY THE 'MESAGE'
ROUTINE, BOTH CYCLES AND STORAGE ARE SAVED BY THIS ELIMINATION (1 CYCLE/
WORD OF MESSAGE, 2 CELLS).

        4. THE LABEL 'RINGEND' HAS BEEN DEFINED, TO REPLACE THE COMMONLY
USED EXPRESSION "RING+RINGSIZE".  THE NEW NAME IS MORE MEANINGFUL AND
LESS AWKWARD.

        5. TWO CELL WERE FREED IN THE 2741 READ ROUTINE BY REORDERING
CODE.

        6. TWO CELLS WERE FREED IN LEPS BY REORDERING CODE.

        7. 'SECE' (ANSWER AND HANG LOGIC' HAS BEEN COMMENTED.

        8. GARBAGE COLLECTION HAS BEEN REORDERED SLIGHTLY SUCH THAT
SHORTER SEQUENCES OF CODE CORRESPOND TO THE MORE COMMON CASES.
VERSION 215.11

        THIS IS AN UPDATE TO AN OLD RELEASE OF CODE.  VERSION 215.01
WAS THE LAST RELEASE WHICH WOULD FIT INTO 8-K NODES.  THIS CODE IS
BECOMING MORE-AND-MORE OBSOLETE, AND THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO UPGRADE THE
CODE FOR 8-K NODES.  A REASONABLE SELECTION OF THE FEATURES ADDED SINCE
VERSION 215.01 HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND ARE INCLUDED IN THIS CODE.

        THIS CODE SHOULD ONLY BE INSTALLED IN 8-K NODES, TO REPLACE
VERSION 215.01.  ALL BIGGER MACHINES SHOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE
LATEST CODE.

        1.  VARIOUS CODE HAS BEEN SHUFFLED AROUND, AND CODE AND STORAGE
CONCERNING MORE THAN 3 LINES ON A REMOTE HAVE BEEN DELETED.

        2.  THE INITIALIZATION CODE HAS BEEN CLEANED UP SLIGHTLY.

        3.  "RTD" HAS BEEN MADE COMPATABLE WITH THE MORE RECENT CODE WITH
RESPECT TO EXCEPTION RECORDS.

        4.  TYPE "N" TERMINAL ID HAS BEEN DELETED, AND TYPE "E" HAS
BEEN MODIFIED SUCH THAT IT WILL SUPPORT THE NEW STYLE T.I. TERMINALS.

        5.  TAKE-OVER COMMANDS ARE VERIFIED BEFORE ACCEPTANCE.

        6.  SUPERVISOR COMMANDS ARE REQUIRED TO COME FROM THE UPSTREAM
DIRECTION.

        7.  ORANGE, YELLOW, BLACK, AND GREY BALLS ARE TREATED CORRECTLY.

        8.  ZAPPED BUFFERS REPORT THE BUFFER NUMBER, RATHER THAN THE
BUFFER ADDRESS.

        9.  THE NODE WILL NOT ZAP THE CURRENT BUFFER, BUT WILL CRASH
IF THE ONLY BUFFER LEFT TO ZAP IS THE CURRENT BUFFER (THE CASE WHERE
ALL THE STORAGE IS ALLOCATED TO ONE BUFFER).

VERSION 215.01

        ONE SLIGHT ERROR IN 215.0 HAS BEEN CORRECTED.  THE FIX CONSISTED
OF MOVING THE "CRASHWORD" POINTER INTO LOW CORE SO THAT IT CAN BE USED
AS AN INDIRECT REFERENCE.

        THE OTHER CHANGES INCLUDE MAKING THE VERSION NUMBER 5 DIGITS
INSTEAD OF 3, WITH THE 3 LEADING DIGITS BEING THE VERSION NUMBER (E.G.,
215) AND THE 2 TRAILING DIGITS BEING THE RELEASE EXTENSION (.01).
IN ADDITION, SOME REDUNDANT CODING WAS ELIMINATED.  THE WORST OFFENDER
IN THIS RESPECT WAS A PIECE OF CODE WHICH PERFORMED THE SAME FUNCTION
IN BOTH THE 8-SECOND AND THE 16-SECOND LOGIC, THE 16-SECOND CASE BEING
CLEARLY REDUNDANT.

VERSION 215.0

        REM214.VAS HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY COMMENTED, AND THE FOLLOWING
CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE:

        1. THE FOLLOWING NEW ASSEMBLY PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN DEFINED:
                LERTRESH DEFINES THE THRESHOLD FOR LINE-ERROR
                        REPORTING.
                LOVTRESH DEFINES THE THRESHOLD FOR LINE-OVERLOAD
                        REPORTING.

        2. THE FOLLOWING FIXED LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN DEFINED:
                LERLIM (133) CONTAINS THE THRESHOLD FOR LINE-ERROR
                        REPORTING.
                LOVLIM (134) CONTAINS THE THRESHOLD FOR LINE-OVERLOAD
                        REPORTING.
                CRPNT (135) CONTAINS A POINTER TO THE CRASH-SAVE TABLE.

        3. FOR 12-K REMOTES, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS SAVED IN THE
CRASH-TABLE.  THIS INCLUDES THE CONTENTS OF THE REGISTERS, AND ONE
ADDITIONAL WORD, THE CONTENTS OF A CELL POINTED AT BY A SPECIAL
POINTER, LABELED "CRASHWORD".  THIS CELL MAY BE SET, USING DEBUGGER,
TO SNAPSHOT ANY CELL.  IT IS INITIALIZED TO POINT AT "WCI", WHICH
IS THE MOST LIKELY PLACE FOR A START-BAUD CRASH TO INTERRUPT.

        4. FOR 12-K REMOTES, THE SPACE FOR BUFFERS IS RESTRICTED TO 4-K
CHARACTERS.  THIS MAY ELIMINATE THOSE START-BAUD CRASHES WHERE EXCESSIVE
TIME IS SPENT IN GARBAGE COLLECTION.

        5. THE REPORTING FOR LINE PROBLEMS HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO USE
THE SPECIFIC PARAMETER LOCATIONS, AND A PREVIOUS ERROR HAS BEEN
CORRECTED.

        6. A GREAT DEAL OF CODE HAS BEEN MOVED AROUND, IN ORDER TO
IMPROVE MEMORY USAGE.  AS A RESULT, THE SOURCE COMPARE IS 16 PAGES
LONG, AND CAN BE FOUND IN (JOHNO:32)REM215.DOC.

        7. ERRORS HAVE BEEN CORRECTED IN THE SECOND PRINTER CODE.
